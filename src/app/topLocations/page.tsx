            Cheung Chau is a small island located in Hong Kong's New
            Territories. It is a popular destination for tourists as it offers a
            peaceful atmosphere and a glimpse into the traditional way of life
            in Hong Kong. Touring Cheung Chau involves exploring its narrow
            streets packed with colorful shops selling local delicacies,
            souvenirs, and fishing gear. One of the most popular must-visit
            attraction on the island is the Pak Tai Temple, which is dedicated
            to the Taoist God, Pak Tai. Hiking enthusiasts can also explore the
            island's hills for scenic views of the surrounding sea and hills.
            There is also a hiking trail, known as the "Mini Great Wall," which
            has been built to resemble China's Great Wall, providing a unique
            experience.

            which is fresh and sourced from the surrounding waters. Seafood
            restaurants are located near the waterfront, where visitors can
            enjoy a variety of seafood dishes. Overall, touring Cheung Chau
            offers a relaxing and enjoyable day trip experience with plenty of
            opportunities to experience Hong Kong's rich culture and stunning
